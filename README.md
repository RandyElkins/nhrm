This project is a starting attempt to at least outline, hopefully detail, issues plaguing the world, and offer solutions (both practical [with current knowledge] and pipedream).

Content here will be a fairly heavy in terms of the shear number of issues that need to be addressed, as well as attempting to view these issues from an overall "40,000ft" general overview, but doing my best to get into more details (perhaps a 50ft view given my lack of knowledge and expertise in the vast majority of topics discussed).
